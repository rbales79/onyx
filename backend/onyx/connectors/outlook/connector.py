"""Outlook connector: Microsoft 365 mail and calendar over Graph.

One document per conversation per mailbox, and with calendars on, one per event
or recurring series. Every Graph call goes through ``OutlookSourceOperations``.
The walk is mailbox by mailbox, folder by folder, then the calendar view, one
delta page per checkpoint step, so a large tenant survives worker restarts.

Incremental runs come from the poll window rather than saved delta links: an
index attempt starts from a fresh checkpoint, so each folder's delta round
opens with ``receivedDateTime ge start`` and any conversation that gained a
message in the window is rebuilt whole.

Pruning walks the same mailboxes, folders and calendar windows but reads only
conversation and event ids, so a conversation whose every message was deleted
leaves the index without a full re-index. A conversation that lost one message
keeps the stale text until it gains a message or a full re-index rebuilds it.
